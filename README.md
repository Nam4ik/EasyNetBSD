**EzNBSD** - C-written free toolkit to make NetBSD more user-friendly.

In my opinion, NetBSD is an extremely useful system for both ancient hardware and simple use, even if it is inferior to OpenBSD/FreeBSD on the desktop. 
I believe that you need to try everything and choose the best for yourself. There are no bindings or tools in NetBSD for easy use and installation. 
The most difficult part of the installation is network problems. These tools will allow you to install NetBSD using the graphical interface (gtk+-3.0), install 
the basic packages, DE, and save you the pain of setting up WIFI.
